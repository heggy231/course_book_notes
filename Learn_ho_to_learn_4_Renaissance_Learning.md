## Week 4: Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

### Introduction

1. THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR BRAIN IS TO : EXERCISE EVERY DAY
    * exercise is by far more effective than any drug at the market today
    * gym and breaks are the most important parts in school

2. You can also exercise the brain, even if it is harder later:
    * it is nearly impossible to get native accent after puberty for secondary language
    * The visual cortex reaches maturation in childhood.
    * The prefrontal cortex reaches maturation in early adulthood.
        * People's ability to do complex analysis.
        * Human social behavior.
        * People's ability to make decisions.
        * People's ability to plan.

3. Learning does not progress in a linear way.


### Metaphors and analogies

* One of the best things you can do to not only remember but understand concepts is to create a metaphor or analogy for it.
* Metaphors and visualization—being able to see something in your mind’s eye—have been especially helpful, not only in art and literature, but also in allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.
* It’s often helpful to pretend you are the concept you are trying to understand.
metaphors and analogies are useful for getting people out of Einstellung—being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.

### Change your thoughts, change your life



### Teamwork



### Testing, the check-list

- Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
- Did you work with classmates on homework problems?
- Did you attempt to outline each homework question before discussing it with classmates?
- Did you participate actively in homework group discussions?
- Did you consult with the instructor/teach assistants when you were having trouble?
- Did you understand all of your homework problem solutions before the assignment was handed in?
- Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problems that were unclear to you?
- If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you understood all of the material?
- Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly without spending time doing the algebra?
- Did you go over the study guide and problems with classmates and quiz one another?
- If there was a review session, did you attend and ask questions about any concepts or ideas that you were unsure of?
- Did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test?

### Hard start - jump to easy

* quick look at everything
* start with hard
* move to easy, give yourself diffused time for the hard stuff

### Hints for tests

* The story you tell yourself about your stress is the actual issue that influences the result
* deep breathing = practice 1-2 min a day weeks before tests
* face your fear, have a plan B
* study hard, let it go
* good worry => helps bring focus
* bad worry => wastes energy

### Summary

* Creating a metaphor or analogy for what you are trying to learn.
* Nobel Prize winner Santiago Ramon y Cajal's example regarding the fact that if you change your thoughts, you can change your life.
* Taking pride in aiming for success because of the very things that make other people say you can’t do it.
* Keeping in mind that when you whiz through a homework or test question and don’t go back to check your work, you are acting a little like a person who is refusing to use parts of your brain.
* Consulting a test check list.
* Using the "hard start - jump to easy" technique.
* Shifting your thinking from “This test has made me afraid” to “This test has got me excited to do my best!”
* Learning to use breathing techniques to help you control feelings of stress and panic when taking tests.
