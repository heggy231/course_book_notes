# Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects
## by Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, Dr. Barbara Oakley
## Week 1: Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

* When we thing we are either in one or another state. We cannot be in both.

* Diffused is the type of thinking you need to do when you are trying to understand something new. The neural resting states that underlie the diffuse mode seem to allow you to be able to cast your thinking much more broadly so you can more easily begin to understand something new.

* Focused is the type of intense concentration you need to work through a problem, step-by-step.

* Using an analogy, the diffuse mode could be thought of as a flashlight set so that it casts its light very broadly, but not very strongly in any one area. (As opposed to the focused mode, which would have its light cast very strongly in a single area, but very weakly everywhere else.)

### Using focused and diffused mode

Dali and Edison:
* let himself think into almost asleep
* woke up with a key drop from his hand

To learn something, especially new, you need to be able to move between of the two modes. You cannot just push through for 24 h without a break. Do a bit everyday. It is the trick.

### What is learning

Brains are really so great that we still have no clue how it really works 100%. We are getting better though. Some of the most simple things we do, are extremely complicated.

Brain does not really get old. It is continuously renewed. New connections are created while we sleep.

**SLEEP** is literally changing you by building your brain.

### Procrastination preview

When you look at something you really do not want to do, your brain activity goes in a place that creates pain. It will really try to convince you to not do it!

### Terrence Sejnowski Interview

1. How do you learn => by doing
2. How do you keep interested in boring => ask questions, make it more yours
3. How do you get into diffused mode => jogging, problem is try to remember it, so he takes notebook
4. Do you multi-task, if not, how you resist urge if not => he has to, because of the job, but he gets his best work done single-tasking. He is a good switch-tasker.
5. How do you apply knowledge of neuroscience to himself => being in a stimulating environment helps out in learning. In absence of environment, exercise helps new neurons being born. So EXERCISE!
6. Any special techniques you acquired? => being in a creative environment
7. Advice for test taking? => You can learn to be a better test taker. It is a skill like any other. DO not get hang up on a question you cannot do.
8. How do you keep creative with more and more routine day by day? => he is lucky, because youth is around, and keep him youthful
9. Advice to college students? => Success is not about being smart. Passion, persistence, attitude.
