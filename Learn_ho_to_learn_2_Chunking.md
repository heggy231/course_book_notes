## Week 2:

There is a bottom-up chunking process where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily gain access to it when needed.

There is a top-down “big picture” process that allows you to see where what you are learning fits in.
Both bottom-up chunking processes and top-down "big picture" processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material.

Chunking may involve your learning how to use a certain problem-solving technique. Context means learning when to use that technique instead of some other technique.


* recall
* focus
* recall in diff place
* mistakes
* minimum highlighting
* notes on the side good
* "had it been my gift it would have come naturally"


## Brain chemistry:

* acetycholine = focus learning, but also unconsicous mind
* dopamine = motivation controller (released on UNEXPECTED reward)
* serotonine = effects social life, linked to risk taking behaviour, lowest levels are in inmates

The structure of scientific revolution book

1. chunk are pieces of info bound through use or meaning
2. chunks can get bigger and more complex
3. best built with focused attention, understanding of the basic idea, practise (recall), recall in a new environment
4. Transfer = > chunks learnd in one area can help in another area
5. interleave = > mix what you study in one session
6. illusions of competence of learning
    * minimize highlight
    * mistakes are good
    * practice difficult stuff
7. Einstellung = old knowledge stops new stuff
8. Law of serendipity = luck favours these who try

## Interviews
* People who are non-agreeing, non-conformists are more creative.
* Fining sweet spot between what you find great and new, and others do. So your new is not too new for others, and they discover it and value.
* zoom in and out from the problem. to think why you do what you do, what is it in the perspective of wholeness
* [Spiders of drugs](http://www.trinity.edu/jdunn/spiderdrugs.htm)
* do not wait until the last moment because you miss on diffused time
* put the time and do not run away from it, give time for the flow
* be critical reader, skip stuff you know

## Week 3: Procrastination and memory
### Understanding the chemistry of procrastination

#### Procrastinate because of:
* unhappy
* uncomfortable

#### Procrastination is related to addiction
* excuses, irrational like alcoholic
* lie to yourself about not being good enough
* it is gradual, just one tiny procrastination, like one tiny beer, and gradually becomes a huge problem

#### Strategies to fight procrastination
* habits
    * cue
    * reaction to cue = start of routine ZOMBIE MODE
    * reward, always here
    * the believe

Procrastination is easy to develop because the reward is so easy to get.

* Put negative thinking aside
* Do not be afraid of bad feeling
* Focus on process not product: 20 min working, not do homework
* The product is the uncomfortable feeling that causes you to feel bad and procrastinate

TO CHANGE A HABIT => CHANGE REACTION TO THE CUE !!!

1. The cues:
    * location
    * time
    * how you feel
    * reactions
2. The routine
    * have a plan, to rewire your brain
    * quiet spot, for productive
    * small steps, adjust and change when not perfect
3. The reward
    * why you procrastinate
    * can you find something instead ?
4. The belief
    * most powerful element, do not give up when tough
    * create new community
    * hang out with people you want to be

### Life and learn

1. Weekly tasks
2. daily tasks, written day before
    * plan the quitting time
3. eat your frogs first every day

### Long-term memory

* The movie "Memento"
* The HM patient cures for epilepsy
* memories are not fixed
* different part of the brain works to learn memories and skills

#### Astrocytes are brain cells that

* Provide nutrients to neurons
* Maintain extracellular (outside the cell) ion balance
* Are involved in repair after injury
* Have a role in learning

####  Creating meaningful groups and the memory palace technique
* Creating connections between things
* letters, numbers, historie ala HaLina K albo Bubn zjadl cyrkonie i zhaftowa na Dubna
* create memory palace technique:  imagine yourself walking through a place you know well, and imagine SHOCKING images with the list objects

#### Summery

* long: practice and repeat in spaced times
* working memory: 4 items !
* moving from working to long makes space for other things
* Select the true statements below in relation to memory

* One way to memorize more easily is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material.
    * Long term memory is like a storage warehouse
    * Working memory is like a poor blackboard that quickly erases itself.
    * The funnier and more evocative the images you make related to what you are trying to remember, the better.

####  Interviews
* Dr. Robert Gamache, an award-winning bilingual scientist
    * Studying French helped the guy with English
    * HIS ADVICE: STUDY EVERY SUBJECT EVERY DAY, at least 15 minutes
* Dr. Norman Fortenberry - Learning at MIT
    * Again: turn off brain, watch stupid TV, cartoons, ect
    * use as many different learning input modes as you can
    * mechanical act of writing helps you learn the material, you learn it once already
    * discussion with peers to challenge what you know and what you do not
* Scott Young
    * have a defined [konkrit] goals
    * learn more by learning less

## Week 4: Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

### Introduction

1. THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR BRAIN IS TO : EXERCISE EVERY DAY
    * exercise is by far more effective than any drug at the market today
    * gym and breaks are the most important parts in school

2. You can also exercise the brain, even if it is harder later:
    * it is nearly impossible to get native accent after puberty for secondary language
    * The visual cortex reaches maturation in childhood.
    * The prefrontal cortex reaches maturation in early adulthood.
        * People's ability to do complex analysis.
        * Human social behavior.
        * People's ability to make decisions.
        * People's ability to plan.

3. Learning does not progress in a linear way.


### Metaphors and analogies

* One of the best things you can do to not only remember but understand concepts is to create a metaphor or analogy for it.
* Metaphors and visualization—being able to see something in your mind’s eye—have been especially helpful, not only in art and literature, but also in allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.
* It’s often helpful to pretend you are the concept you are trying to understand.
metaphors and analogies are useful for getting people out of Einstellung—being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.

### Change your thoughts, change your life



### Teamwork



### Testing, the check-list

- Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
- Did you work with classmates on homework problems?
- Did you attempt to outline each homework question before discussing it with classmates?
- Did you participate actively in homework group discussions?
- Did you consult with the instructor/teach assistants when you were having trouble?
- Did you understand all of your homework problem solutions before the assignment was handed in?
- Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problems that were unclear to you?
- If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you understood all of the material?
- Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly without spending time doing the algebra?
- Did you go over the study guide and problems with classmates and quiz one another?
- If there was a review session, did you attend and ask questions about any concepts or ideas that you were unsure of?
- Did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test?

### Hard start - jump to easy

* quick look at everything
* start with hard
* move to easy, give yourself diffused time for the hard stuff

### Hints for tests

* The story you tell yourself about your stress is the actual issue that influences the result
* deep breathing = practice 1-2 min a day weeks before tests
* face your fear, have a plan B
* study hard, let it go
* good worry => helps bring focus
* bad worry => wastes energy

### Summary

* Creating a metaphor or analogy for what you are trying to learn.
* Nobel Prize winner Santiago Ramon y Cajal's example regarding the fact that if you change your thoughts, you can change your life.
* Taking pride in aiming for success because of the very things that make other people say you can’t do it.
* Keeping in mind that when you whiz through a homework or test question and don’t go back to check your work, you are acting a little like a person who is refusing to use parts of your brain.
* Consulting a test check list.
* Using the "hard start - jump to easy" technique.
* Shifting your thinking from “This test has made me afraid” to “This test has got me excited to do my best!”
* Learning to use breathing techniques to help you control feelings of stress and panic when taking tests.
