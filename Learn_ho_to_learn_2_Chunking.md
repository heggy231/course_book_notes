There is a bottom-up chunking process where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily gain access to it when needed.

There is a top-down “big picture” process that allows you to see where what you are learning fits in.
Both bottom-up chunking processes and top-down "big picture" processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material.

Chunking may involve your learning how to use a certain problem-solving technique. Context means learning when to use that technique instead of some other technique.


* recall
* focus
* recall in diff place
* mistakes
* minimum highlighting

* dopamine = motivation controller (released on UNEXPECTED reward)
* serotonine = effects social life, linked to risk taking behaviour, lowest levels are in inmates

The structure of scientific revolution book

1. chunk are pieces of info bound through use or meaning
2. chunks can get bigger and more complex
3. best built with focused attention, understanding of the basic idea, practise (recall), recall in a new environment
4. Transfer = > chunks learnd in one area can help in another area
5. interleave = > mix what you study in one session
6. illusions of competence of learning
    * minimize highlight
    * mistakes are good
    * practice difficult stuff
7. Einstellung = old knowledge stops new stuff
8. Law of serendipity = luck favours these who try

## Interviews
* People who are non-agreeing, non-conformists are more creative.
* Fining sweet spot between what you find great and new, and others do. So your new is not too new for others, and they discover it and value.
* zoom in and out from the problem. to think why you do what you do, what is it in the perspective of wholeness

* do not wait until the last moment because you miss on diffused time
* put the time and do not run away from it, give time for the flow
* be critical reader, skip stuff you know
