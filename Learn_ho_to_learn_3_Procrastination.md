## Week 3: Procrastination and memory
### Understanding the chemistry of procrastination

#### Procrastinate because of:
* unhappy
* uncomfortable

#### Procrastination is related to addiction
* excuses, irrational like alcoholic
* lie to yourself about not being good enough
* it is gradual, just one tiny procrastination, like one tiny beer, and gradually becomes a huge problem

#### Strategies to fight procrastination
* habits
    * cue
    * reaction to cue = start of routine ZOMBIE MODE
    * reward, always here
    * the believe

Procrastination is easy to develop because the reward is so easy to get.

* Put negative thinking aside
* Do not be afraid of bad feeling
* Focus on process not product: 20 min working, not do homework
* The product is the uncomfortable feeling that causes you to feel bad and procrastinate

TO CHANGE A HABIT => CHANGE REACTION TO THE CUE !!!

1. The cues:
    * location
    * time
    * how you feel
    * reactions
2. The routine
    * have a plan, to rewire your brain
    * quiet spot, for productive
    * small steps, adjust and change when not perfect
3. The reward
    * why you procrastinate
    * can you find something instead ?
4. The belief
    * most powerful element, do not give up when tough
    * create new community
    * hang out with people you want to be

### Life and learn

1. Weekly tasks
2. daily tasks, written day before
    * plan the quitting time
3. eat your frogs first every day

### Long-term memory

* The movie "Memento"
* The HM patient cures for epilepsy
* memories are not fixed
* different part of the brain works to learn memories and skills

#### Astrocytes are brain cells that

* Provide nutrients to neurons
* Maintain extracellular (outside the cell) ion balance
* Are involved in repair after injury
* Have a role in learning

####  Creating meaningful groups and the memory palace technique
* Creating connections between things
* letters, numbers, historie ala HaLina K albo Bubn zjadl cyrkonie i zhaftowa na Dubna
* create memory palace technique:  imagine yourself walking through a place you know well, and imagine SHOCKING images with the list objects

#### Summery

* long: practice and repeat in spaced times
* working memory: 4 items !
* moving from working to long makes space for other things
* Select the true statements below in relation to memory

* One way to memorize more easily is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material.
    * Long term memory is like a storage warehouse
    * Working memory is like a poor blackboard that quickly erases itself.
    * The funnier and more evocative the images you make related to what you are trying to remember, the better.

####  Interviews
* Dr. Robert Gamache, an award-winning bilingual scientist
    * Studying French helped the guy with English
    * HIS ADVICE: STUDY EVERY SUBJECT EVERY DAY, at least 15 minutes
* Dr. Norman Fortenberry - Learning at MIT
    * Again: turn off brain, watch stupid TV, cartoons, ect
    * use as many different learning input modes as you can
    * mechanical act of writing helps you learn the material, you learn it once already
    * discussion with peers to challenge what you know and what you do not
* Scott Young
    * have a defined [konkrit] goals
    * learn more by learning less
